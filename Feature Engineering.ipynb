    "Handling Categorical Variables in Machine Learning\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Label Encoding\n",
    "Label encoding is a technique where each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with categories \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\", we can assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to each category, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a technique where each category is represented as a binary vector. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with categories \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\", we can represent each category as a binary vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red: [1, 0, 0]\n",
    "- Green: [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "- Blue: [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a technique where each category is assigned a numerical value based on its order or ranking. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"size\" with categories \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", we can assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to each category, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Binary Encoding\n",

    "- Green: 01\n",

    "\n",
    "Common Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cardinality: Be mindful of the number of categories in your variable. High-cardinality variables can lead to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "2. Encoding technique: Choose an encoding technique that suits your problem and data. For example, one-hot encoding can lead to sparse data, while label encoding can imply ordinal relationships.\n",
    "3. Model selection: Some machine learning models can handle categorical variables directly, while others require numerical representations."

    "1. Standardization: This technique scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is also known as z-scoring.\n",
    "2. Normalization: This technique scales the features to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1. It is also known as min-max scaling.\n",
